## Inspiration 

Handling medical documents and paperwork has always been a hassle, and moreover, since social distancing has become the new norm, it only makes sense to switch to a digitized medium.
So, we have come up with a solution to eliminate the need to deal with paperwork by the use of a specialized mobile app which will keep track of your medical files.
With the ongoing pandemic, we have all come to realize that the doctors and the healthcare workers are our real heroes.  Our goal is to make their lives a bit easier via this app. 

## What it does  

The Prescribe app is a Java based application which aims at eliminating the use of paperwork in the medical industry and ensuring minimal physical interaction. It stores all the medical records/documents on the Google cloud to ensure that your data is safe.
It includes the following features :
1.	Automatically saves your prescription and medical records
2.	Verification of doctors. This will ensure that your data will not go to the wrong hands.
3.	Doctors are able to send reports and prescriptions to the patients by scanning the patient’s QR code.
4.	Patients can edit and save their details in their profile page and send these details to the doctors.  
5.	The app ensures no misplacement of papers and reports.
## How we built it  

-	After quite a bit of time spent on coming up with an idea, we finally landed on this topic which can be of some use to the doctors and the patients.
-	Then, we decided on how to proceed with this idea.
-	Thought and discussed about the app layout and the overall design, it’s main features etc.
-	Then, we decided to use Firebase SDK and Google Cloud to store and process our data.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of  

So as of now, we are newbies to the world of hackathons and we hope to explore this fantastic arena more. First of all, we are Thankful to Hero Hacks,(it’s sponsors) and MLH for letting us participate in this hackathon. More than anything we enjoyed building the application in the given time frame and even more happy that we were able to think of a solution to the problem to solace our community, On top of all this we are absolutely certain that the bonding of our team members has increased to a next level. And now We are looking forward to participating in more hackathons, thanks to MLH and the sponsors.  

## What's next for Health-Heroes  

-	Our first plan of action would be to reach out to clinics or small-scale medical organizations and propose this idea of an application to them.
-	Connecting pharmacists with this app to make the delivering process of medicines much smoother.
-	The feature to book appointments would also be implemented in the future.
